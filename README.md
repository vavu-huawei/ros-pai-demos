# ROS Physical AI Demos

Open-source physical AI demos for the [SO-ARM101](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) robot arm on ROS 2 — simulation (Gazebo, MuJoCo) and real hardware, with a full Record → Train → Deploy learning pipeline powered by [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).

## Quick start

Requires Linux and [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) (which bundles ROS 2, Gazebo, and all dependencies). An NVIDIA GPU is only needed for ML inference/training, not for simulation. For full requirements and the manual install path, see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ros-physical-ai/demos
cd demos
vcs import external < pai.repos --recursive
pixi install
pixi run install-ml-deps   # PyTorch + LeRobot (auto-detects GPU)
pixi run build
```

Launch the SO-ARM101 in Gazebo (start the Zenoh router first, in its own terminal):

```bash
pixi run start_zenoh   # terminal 1
pixi run so-arm-gz     # terminal 2
```

See [Running the Robot](docs/running-the-robot.md) for MuJoCo and real-hardware bringup.

## Demos

### Try a Pre-trained Policy in Simulation

New to the repo? Skip the slow Record → Train → Deploy loop and see a working policy in Gazebo in minutes. We provide **60 pre-recorded rosbags**, a **converted LeRobot dataset**, and a **trained ACT policy** — all hosted on the HuggingFace Hub. Just point `rosetta_client_launch.py` at the checkpoint and run inference. See [Try a Pre-trained Policy](docs/demos/pretrained-demo.md) for the full walkthrough.

### End-to-End Learning Pipeline with SO-ARM

Record demonstrations, train a policy, and deploy it on the robot — in simulation or on real hardware, using any input method (leader arm teleoperation, scripted commands, or custom controllers). For the full guide, see [End-to-End Learning Pipeline with Rosetta](docs/demos/end-to-end-pipeline.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These videos show an **ACT** policy trained on the recorded episodes. The goal here is to demonstrate the full **Record → Train → Deploy** pipeline — not to showcase optimal policy performance, which depends on the number of episodes, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
